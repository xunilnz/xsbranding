# XSBranding - Sample Branding Scripts

Deploying Linux from an ISO and branding it with your themes and colour schemes, wallpaper can make a distro your own.

The XSBranding script, shows how you can go about changing some of the default branding on various Linux Distro's.

Please note: this is a work in progress, It has been tested on several of my own Linux installs, but use it at your own risk.

Things will get smarter as I build this out. Feel free to fork it and have a play.

## Tested on
    Linux Mint - Cinnamon
    Arch Linux - with Plymouth already installed and configured.
