# XSBranding - Sample Branding Scripts

Deploying Linux from an ISO and branding it with your themes and colour schemes, wallpaper can make a distro your own.

The XSBranding script, shows how you can go about changing some of the default branding on various Linux Distro's.

Please note: this is a work in progress, It has been tested on several of my own Linux installs, but use it at your own risk.

Things will get smarter as I build this out. Feel free to fork it and have a play.

**Requires Plymouth to be installed and configured** 

Linux Mint has Plymouth installed out of the box.

Arch Linux requires you to configure it. ToDo: Automate this in the script.
